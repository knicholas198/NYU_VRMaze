# NYU_VRMaze

The maze was fun to build. I had to figure out how to make the levers work as triggers when they are pulled away. I am still trying to make an audio clip play when the door is opened, but have not been able to figure out why it will not play. I enjoyed making the dead ends and path loop. I used youtube for help a few times for scripting.
